## Overview

Create subnet for a VPC in AWS

Capabilities include:
- The workflow is used to create subnet for a VPC in AWS


## Getting Started

### Supported IAP Versions

Itential Workflow Projects are built and tested on particular versions of IAP. In addition, Workflow Projects are often dependent on external systems and as such, these Workflow Projects will have dependencies on these other systems. This version of **Create VPC Subnet - AWS** has been tested with:


- IAP **2023.1**



### External Dependencies

This version of **Create VPC Subnet - AWS** has been tested with:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>OS Version</th>
      <th>API Version</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>AWS</td>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>




### Adapters

This version of **Create VPC Subnet - AWS** has been tested with:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Version</th>
      <th>Configuration Notes</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>adapter-aws_ec2</td>
      <td>^0.7.2</td>
      <td>In order to run the workflows in this Pre-Built, the adapter property `xmlArrayKeys` must be added to the AWS EC2 adapter configuration and be assigned the value:

```json
[
  "item"
]
```

This will ensure all response objects will set the data type of any instance of property `item` to an array, even if a single element is assigned to the property.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
