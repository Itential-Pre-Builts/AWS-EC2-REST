Capabilities include:
- The workflow is used to create and attach Internet gateway to VPC in AWS


## Getting Started

### Supported IAP Versions

Itential Workflow Projects are built and tested on particular versions of IAP. In addition, Workflow Projects are often dependent on external systems and as such, these Workflow Projects will have dependencies on these other systems. This version of **Create and Attach Internet Gateway - AWS** has been tested with:


- IAP **2023.1**



### External Dependencies

This version of **Create and Attach Internet Gateway - AWS** has been tested with:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>OS Version</th>
      <th>API Version</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>AWS</td>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>




### Adapters

This version of **Create and Attach Internet Gateway - AWS** has been tested with:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Version</th>
      <th>Configuration Notes</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="https://gitlab.com/itentialopensource/adapters/cloud/adapter-aws_ec2">adapter-aws_ec2</a></td>
      <td>^0.7.2</td>
      <td>In order to run the workflows in this Pre-Built Automation, the adapter property <code>xmlArrayKeys</code> must be added to the AWS EC2 adapter configuration with value as seen below:

```json
"xmlArrayKeys": [
  "item"
]
```

This will ensure all response objects will set the data type of any instance of property <code>item</code> to an array, even if a single element is assigned to the property.</td>
